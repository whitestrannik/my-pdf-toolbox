## ✅ Phase 4: Core PDF Logic _(COMPLETED)_

- [x] `merge.ts` – Merge multiple PDFs
- [x] `convert.ts` – Convert images to PDF
- [x] `split.ts` – Split PDFs into multiple PDFs (range/page)
- [x] `split.ts` – Split PDFs into images (JPG/PNG)
- [x] `compress.ts` – Compress PDFs with quality levels
- [x] `reorder.ts` – Reorder pages in PDF

Each utility must be:

- A pure function ✅
- Unit tested ✅
- Return usable errors ✅

**Completed:**

- **Core PDF Utilities:** All 5 utilities implemented with full TypeScript support
  - `merge.ts`: Combines multiple PDF files with validation and error handling
  - `convert.ts`: Converts images (JPEG, PNG) to PDF with automatic scaling
  - `split.ts`: Splits PDFs to multiple PDFs or images with range/page selection
  - `compress.ts`: PDF compression with 3 levels (low, medium, high) and size reporting
  - `reorder.ts`: Page reordering with validation and utility helper functions
- **Dependencies:** Installed pdf-lib, pdfjs-dist, file-saver, jszip with TypeScript types
- **Pure Functions:** All utilities are pure functions with consistent interfaces
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 60 unit tests across all utilities (100% coverage of logic)
  - Input validation, error handling, return structure validation
  - Proper mocking for browser APIs in test environment
  - All tests passing with Vitest
- **Error Handling:** Consistent success/failure response patterns with detailed error messages
- **Build Verification:** TypeScript compilation and production build successful

  - [x] Reorder Pages - Complete with drag & drop page reordering interface, visual feedback
  - [x] Images to PDF - Complete with multiple image upload, settings, conversion
- [x] Input validation + user feedback
  - [x] File type validation (PDF/images), 20MB size limits
  - [x] Real-time error messages and progress feedback
  - [x] Success notifications with result details
- [x] Render thumbnails with `pdfjs-dist`
