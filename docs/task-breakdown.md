# âœ… Task Breakdown: My-PDF Toolbox

This document outlines the step-by-step development tasks for the MVP (P0) release, following the PRD and architecture guidelines.

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Project Setup *(COMPLETED)*
- [x] Initialize project with Vite + React + TypeScript
  - `npm create vite@latest my-pdf-toolbox --template react-ts`
- [x] Configure TailwindCSS
  - `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
  - `npx tailwindcss init -p`
  - Add Tailwind setup in `tailwind.config.ts` and `index.css`
- [x] Set up folder structure
  - `components`, `views`, `pdf-utils`, `hooks`, `context`, `assets`, `styles`
- [x] Add ESLint + Prettier config
  - Add `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, and install dependencies
- [x] Create GitHub repo & CI placeholder
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml`

**Completed:** Cleaned up default Vite files, set up project structure, configured ESLint/Prettier integration, created CI workflow.

---

## âœ… Phase 2: Tooling & Test Infrastructure *(COMPLETED)*
- [x] Install Vitest + React Testing Library
- [x] Install Playwright (headless + headed)
- [x] Add test scripts: `npm run test`, `npm run e2e`, `npm run e2e:ui`
- [x] Create sample unit test and E2E sanity test

**Completed:** 
- Upgraded to Vitest 3.2.0 with React Testing Library
- Configured Playwright for E2E testing
- Fixed memory issues and test execution
- All tests passing: 2 unit tests, 1 E2E test
- Proper test separation (Vitest for unit, Playwright for E2E)

---

## âœ… Phase 3: UI Foundation *(COMPLETED)*
- [x] Header with title + dark/light toggle
- [x] Dashboard or toolbar layout
- [x] Create reusable UI components:
  - `Button`, `Card`, `Dropzone`, `Modal`, `Toggle`
- [x] Create routes + views for each tool
  - combine, split, compress, reorder
- [x] Add animated drag-and-drop support

**Completed:**
- **Core Components:** Button (variants, sizes, loading), Card, Toggle, Dropzone, Modal
- **Layout:** Header with branding and theme toggle, Navigation with tool tabs
- **Theme System:** Complete dark/light mode with localStorage and system detection
- **Routing:** React Router setup with all tool routes and placeholder views
- **Homepage:** Professional dashboard with tool cards and privacy messaging
- **Testing:** Updated unit tests (3 passing) and E2E tests (3 passing)
- **Design:** Modern TailwindCSS design system with sky blue theme and animations

## âœ… Phase 4: Core PDF Logic *(COMPLETED)*
- [x] `merge.ts` â€“ Merge multiple PDFs
- [x] `convert.ts` â€“ Convert images to PDF
- [x] `split.ts` â€“ Split PDFs into multiple PDFs (range/page)
- [x] `split.ts` â€“ Split PDFs into images (JPG/PNG)
- [x] `compress.ts` â€“ Compress PDFs with quality levels
- [x] `reorder.ts` â€“ Reorder pages in PDF

Each utility must be:
- A pure function âœ…
- Unit tested âœ…
- Return usable errors âœ…

**Completed:**
- **Core PDF Utilities:** All 5 utilities implemented with full TypeScript support
  - `merge.ts`: Combines multiple PDF files with validation and error handling
  - `convert.ts`: Converts images (JPEG, PNG) to PDF with automatic scaling
  - `split.ts`: Splits PDFs to multiple PDFs or images with range/page selection
  - `compress.ts`: PDF compression with 3 levels (low, medium, high) and size reporting
  - `reorder.ts`: Page reordering with validation and utility helper functions
- **Dependencies:** Installed pdf-lib, pdfjs-dist, file-saver, jszip with TypeScript types
- **Pure Functions:** All utilities are pure functions with consistent interfaces
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 60 unit tests across all utilities (100% coverage of logic)
  - Input validation, error handling, return structure validation
  - Proper mocking for browser APIs in test environment
  - All tests passing with Vitest
- **Error Handling:** Consistent success/failure response patterns with detailed error messages
- **Build Verification:** TypeScript compilation and production build successful

## âœ… Phase 5: Feature Integration *(COMPLETED)*
- [x] Connect UI with PDF utilities
  - [x] Combine PDFs - Complete with file validation, thumbnails, reordering, merging, downloads
  - [x] Split PDF - Complete with PDF/image output, ZIP packaging, page ranges
  - [x] Compress PDF - Complete with 3 compression levels, size comparison, downloads
  - [x] Reorder Pages - Complete with drag & drop page reordering interface, visual feedback
  - [x] Images to PDF - Complete with multiple image upload, settings, conversion
- [x] Input validation + user feedback
  - [x] File type validation (PDF/images), 20MB size limits
  - [x] Real-time error messages and progress feedback
  - [x] Success notifications with result details
- [x] Render thumbnails with `pdfjs-dist`
  - [x] Real-time PDF thumbnail generation (offline workers)
  - [x] Canvas-based rendering with optimized scale
  - [x] Fallback placeholders for generation errors
- [x] Enable file downloads with `file-saver`
  - [x] Direct PDF downloads with timestamped filenames
  - [x] Automatic filename generation with tool/level indicators
- [x] Zip image exports (split output) using `JSZip`
  - [x] Multiple PDF files packaged as ZIP
  - [x] Image collections (split to images) as ZIP
  - [x] Proper file naming and organization

**Completed: 5/5 utilities** - All Phase 5 requirements fulfilled
